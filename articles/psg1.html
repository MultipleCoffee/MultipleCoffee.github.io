        <div class="g-col-6 g-col-md-4">The old man sat on his porch, watching the sun set over the horizon. He had
            lived in this small town his whole life and had seen many changes. But one thing that never changed was the
            beauty of the sunset. As the last light disappeared, he closed his eyes and smiled. He knew that, although
            he may not have much time left, he had lived a full life. And he was content.</div>
        <div class="g-col-6 g-col-md-4">Samantha loved to run. Every morning, she would wake up early and head to the
            park to jog. It was her favorite way to start the day. One morning, she noticed a small puppy wandering
            around alone. She stopped and picked him up. He was so cute! She decided to take him home with her. From
            that day on, they became inseparable. She would take him on her runs, and he would run alongside her,
            wagging his tail. Running was always fun, but now it was even better with her new furry friend.</div>
        <div class="g-col-6 g-col-md-4">Tom had always wanted to travel the world. So, he saved up enough money to buy a
            one-way ticket to his first destination: Tokyo. The moment he arrived, he was blown away by the city's
            energy and beauty. He spent his days wandering through the streets, taking in the sights and sounds. One
            evening, he stumbled upon a small bar where he met a group of locals who welcomed him with open arms. They
            introduced him to their culture, food, and music, and he felt like he had found a second home. As he
            continued his travels, he never forgot the kindness of those strangers in Tokyo.</div>
